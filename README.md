# Welcome to *SoundShape*!
Here, you will find informations on a promising, yet little explored method for biacoustical analysis: the *eigensound* protocol ([MacLeod *et al.*, 2013](http://www.italian-journal-of-mammalogy.it/Geometric-Morphometric-Approaches-to-Acoustic-Signal-Analysis-in-Mammalian-Biology,77249,0,2.html)). 

*Eigensound* is a multidisciplinary approach that crosses the bridge between Bioacoustics and Geometric Morphometrics, thus enabling the direct comparison between stereotyped calls from different species. However well described by Macleod *et al.*, the method still lacked a viable platform to run the analysis, meaning that the bridge is still not *crossable* for those unfamiliar with programing codes.

`SoundShape` was built to fill this gap. It feature the functions required for anyone to easily go from sound waves onto Principal Components, using tools extracted from traditional Bioacoustics (*i.e.* [tuneR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tuneR/index.html) and [seewave](http://rug.mnhn.fr/seewave/) packages), Geometric Morphometrics (*i.e.* [geomorph](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geomorph/index.html) package) and multivariate analysis (*e.g.* [stats](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/00Index.html) package). In addition to the original methods description (MacLeod *et al.,* 2013), we are currently developing a throughout paper detailing `SoundShape` (Rocha & Romano *in prep*).

*Thanks for using* `SoundShape` *and enjoy your reading!* 

**Note:** This is still an early version of `SoundShape`. Should you experience problems running any function, please feel free to report any [issues here](https://github.com/p-rocha/SoundShape/issues).

## Getting started


### Instalation
`SoundShape` is currently available on [R platform](https://www.r-project.org/) as a development version from GitHub. In order to download it, make sure to have already installed an updated `R` version (>=3.3.1) and [devtools](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools) package. 

```r
# devtools - In case you don't have it
install.packages("devtools")

# SoundShape - Install the development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("p-rocha/SoundShape")
```

### Workflow using `SoundShape`
The method described by MacLeod *et al.* (2013) considers the graphical representation of sound (*i.e.* a spectrogram) as complex three-dimensional (3D) surfaces from which topologically homologous semilandmarks (SM) can be acquired using a predefined sampling grid.

`threeDspectro` provide an easy way to visualize sound waves as 3D graphs with or without a sampling grid, and also to view the sampled 3D SM as colored points.

#### Codes for the images above:
```r
# Sample data from SoundShape
data(cuvieri)

# Select stereotyped acoustic unit from sample
cuvieri.cut <- seewave::cutw(cuvieri, f=44100, from = 0.05, to=0.45, output="Wave")

# a. Oscillogram
seewave::oscillo(cuvieri.cut)

# b. 2D spectrogram
seewave::spectro(cuvieri.cut, flim=c(0, 2.5), grid=FALSE, scale=FALSE)

# c. 3D spectrogram
threeDspectro(cuvieri.cut, flim=c(0, 2.5), rotate.Xaxis=60, rotate.Yaxis=40)

# d. 3D spectrogram - sampled surface
threeDspectro(cuvieri.cut, samp.grid=TRUE, x.length=70, y.length=50,
              flim=c(0, 2.5), rotate.Xaxis=60, rotate.Yaxis=40)

# e. 3D spectrogram - semilandmarks from sampled surface
threeDspectro(cuvieri.cut, samp.grid=TRUE, x.length=70, y.length=50, plot.type="points",
              flim=c(0, 2.5), rotate.Xaxis=60, rotate.Yaxis=40)
```

The `eigensound` function, on the other hand, focus on the acquisition of SM coordinates from multiple `".wav"` files. For each `".wav"` file on a given folder, `eigensound` will compute spectrogram data and acquire semilandmarks that can be within the sample of species. 

However, all `".wav"` files must be stored on the same folder, which can be created at the current [working directory](http://rprogramming.net/set-working-directory-in-r/). In addition, we also create a subfolder to store the upcoming outputs from `eigensound`.

```r
# Create folder at current working directory
wav.at <- file.path(getwd(), "example SoundShape")
dir.create(wav.at)

# Create subfolder to store results
store.at <- file.path(getwd(), "example SoundShape/output")
dir.create(store.at)
```

Each `".wav"` file must represent a single homologous (*i.e.* stereotyped) acoustic unit selected from the sample. The selection can be performed on numerous softwares of acoustic analysis outside `R` platform (*e.g.* [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/), [Raven Pro](http://ravensoundsoftware.com/software/raven-pro/)). 

Or using some functions from [seewave](http://rug.mnhn.fr/seewave/).

#### Codes for the image above:
```r
# Sample data from SoundShape
data(cuvieri)

# Plot spectro from sample and highlight acoustic units
seewave::spectro(cuvieri, flim = c(0,2.5))
graphics::abline(v=c(0.05, 0.45, 0.73, 1.13, 1.47, 1.87), lty=2)

# Select acoustic units
cut.cuvieri1 <- seewave::cutw(cuvieri, f=44100, from=0.05, to=0.45, output = "Wave")
cut.cuvieri2 <- seewave::cutw(cuvieri, f=44100, from=0.73, to=1.13, output = "Wave")
cut.cuvieri3 <- seewave::cutw(cuvieri, f=44100, from=1.47, to=1.87, output = "Wave")

# Export new ".wav" files containing acoustic units and store on previosly created folder
seewave::writeWave(cut.cuvieri1, filename = file.path(wav.at, "cut.cuvieri1.wav"), extensible=FALSE)
seewave::writeWave(cut.cuvieri2, filename = file.path(wav.at, "cut.cuvieri2.wav"), extensible=FALSE)
seewave::writeWave(cut.cuvieri3, filename = file.path(wav.at, "cut.cuvieri3.wav"), extensible=FALSE)
```

In addition to `cuvieri` sample data, `SoundShape` also feature `centralis` and `kroyeri` `"Wave"` samples. We repeated the same procedure to acquire stereotyped calls from these species and stored the new `".wav"` files on the same folder specified by `wav.at`. 

Therefore, our sample data is composed of nine acoustic units (three per species). 

**Note:** Codes omitted for practical reasons

```r
# Sample data
data(centralis)
data(kroyeri)

# Plot spectros from sample and highlight acoustic units
seewave::spectro(centralis, flim = c(0, 3)) 
graphics::abline(v=c(0.1, 0.8, 1.08, 1.78, 2.1, 2.8), lty=2)

seewave::spectro(kroyeri, flim = c(0, 4), grid=FALSE, scalecexlab = 1.5, cexlab = 1.3, cexaxis = 1.3, oma=c(1,1,1,1)) # Visualize sound data that will be used
graphics::abline(v=c(0.16, 0.96, 1.55, 2.35, 2.9, 3.8), lty=2)

# Select acoustic units
cut.centralis1 <- seewave::cutw(centralis, f=44100, from=0.1, to=0.8, output = "Wave")
cut.centralis2 <- seewave::cutw(centralis, f=44100, from=1.08, to=1.78, output = "Wave")
cut.centralis3 <- seewave::cutw(centralis, f=44100, from=2.1, to=2.8, output = "Wave")

cut.kroyeri1 <- seewave::cutw(kroyeri, f=44100, from=0.16, to=0.96, output = "Wave")
cut.kroyeri2 <- seewave::cutw(kroyeri, f=44100, from=1.55, to=2.35, output = "Wave")
cut.kroyeri3 <- seewave::cutw(kroyeri, f=44100, from=2.9, to=3.8, output = "Wave")

# Export new ".wav" files containing acoustic units and store on previosly created folder
seewave::writeWave(cut.centralis1, filename = file.path(wav.at, "cut.centralis1.wav"), extensible = FALSE)
seewave::writeWave(cut.centralis2, filename = file.path(wav.at, "cut.centralis2.wav"), extensible = FALSE)
seewave::writeWave(cut.centralis3, filename = file.path(wav.at, "cut.centralis3.wav"), extensible = FALSE)
seewave::writeWave(cut.kroyeri1, filename = file.path(wav.at, "cut.kroyeri1.wav"), extensible = FALSE)
seewave::writeWave(cut.kroyeri2, filename = file.path(wav.at, "cut.kroyeri2.wav"), extensible = FALSE)
seewave::writeWave(cut.kroyeri3, filename = file.path(wav.at, "cut.kroyeri3.wav"), extensible = FALSE)

```
For each `".wav"` file on a given folder, `eigensound` will compute spectrogram data and acquire SM using a three-dimensional representation of sound (`analysis.type = "threeDshape"`), or the cross-correlation between energy quantiles and a curve of relative amplitude (`analysis.type = "twoDshape"`). The results can be simultaneosly assigned to an `R` object, and/or stored as a `".tps"` file to be used by numerous softwares of geometric analysis of shape, such as the TPS series ([Rohlf, 2015](http://www.italian-journal-of-mammalogy.it/The-tps-series-of-software,77186,0,2.html)).

(whose path can be specified by `store.at`)

SM can be acquired using a 3D representation of sound (`analysis.type = "threeDshape"`), or the cross-correlation between energy quantiles and a curve of relative amplitude (`analysis.type = "twoDshape"`), which will be further discussed in Rocha & Romano (*in prep*). Ultimately, one might also export two or three-dimensional plots as `jpeg` (compressed image) or `tiff` (uncompressed image) file formats, which can be edited for publication purposes.

```r

## Crossing the bridge between Bioacoustics and Geometric Morphometrics

The three-dimensional SM coordinates can be submitted to Principal Components Analysis, which will calculate new variables (Principal Components â€“ PC) that are independent from each other and represent the axis of greatest
variation in the dataset of sound waves. By doing so, complex waves are now be described by a few PCs that can be used to produce ordination plots encompassing the majority of variation among the calls.

Although MacLeod et al. (2013) clearly stated the methods for SM acquisition, they did not mention the softwares required for the so called *eigensound analysis*. Therefore, `SoundShape` package feature a set of functions that reproduce the methods from the positioning of sounds at beggining of sound window until the PCA plot with convex hulls around each group.
